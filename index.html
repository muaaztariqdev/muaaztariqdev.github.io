          I'm Muhammad Muaaz Tariq, a passionate and detail-oriented Full Stack
          Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience building scalable,
          high-performance web applications. My core expertise spans both
          backend and frontend development â€” from crafting RESTful APIs with
          Node.js, NestJS, and Django, to creating responsive UIs using React,
          TypeScript, and modern design systems like Material UI and Ant Design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've led projects across diverse domains, implemented microservices
          architectures with message queues like RabbitMQ and Kafka, and
          optimized infrastructure on AWS using services like EC2, Lambda, and
          RDS. Whether it's building cloud-native applications, mentoring junior
          developers, or writing clean, reusable code, I bring dedication,
          efficiency, and a problem-solving mindset to every project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive in agile teams and remote environments, and I'm always eager
          to tackle new challenges and deliver impactful solutions.

                    Multiple Dashboards:
                  </b>
                  Each user is allowed to create and manage multiple dashboards, 
                  with the option to designate one as the default. 
                  The default dashboard functions as the user's homepage upon login.
                   In the absence of a designated default, the user is redirected 
                   to an overview page displaying thumbnails of all available dashboards.

                    Exposing API Server:
                  </b>
                  A client company required access to the TSIM server's APIs in order to 
                  integrate its own backend system with the TSIM infrastructure.
                   Directing their users to log in to the TSIM server was not a viable solution.
                    To facilitate this integration, I exposed the necessary server endpoints
                     by generating API keys specifically for TSIM clients. Authentication between 
                     the client's server and the TSIM backend was securely handled using the 
                     OAuth protocol.

              TRP is a telehealth business intelligence platform that centralizes
               and analyzes real-time data from clinical, financial and operational 
               sources to gain actionable insights on everything from quality of care 
               outcomes to ROI.

                    Zoom APIs Integration:
                  </b>
                  I integrated Zoom APIs to retrieve meeting data for analytical purposes, specifically focusing on
                   virtual consultations between healthcare providers and patients. The integration
                    captured information related to meetings and their participants. To enable real-time
                     data processing, Zoom Webhooks were also implemented. The registered webhook events 
                     included key meeting and participant activities such as meeting start and end, participant
                      join and leave, screen sharing, and disconnection events.

                    Group Based Permission:
                  </b>
                  User permissions were managed through user groups, with each group assigned
                   access to specific modules. To grant a user access to a particular module, 
                   the user had to be added to a group that already possessed the required 
                   permissions. If a user needed access to only one specific module (e.g., module M), 
                   it was necessary to either locate an existing group with access solely to
                    that module or create a new group (e.g., group G), assign the relevant module
                     permissions to it, and then add the user (e.g., user U) to that group. Users 
                     who were not assigned to any group did not have access to any modules.

                  <b>Multi-Tenancy:</b>
                  The product was designed to support multiple clients, necessitating a clear separation
                   of concerns on a per-tenant basis. To achieve this, multi-tenancy was implemented 
                   in the backend. A single backend and database instance served all tenants, with the 
                   architecture carefully designed to enforce tenant isolation and ensure secure,
                    efficient multi-tenant operations.

                <li>
                  <b>Single-Sign-On with Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS):</b>
                  Single Sign-On (SSO) is typically implemented when product tenants prefer to manage
                   user authentication independently and avoid sharing user data. This was the case 
                   for TRP as well. In accordance with the client's requirements, authentication was 
                   integrated using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).

                    Share Dashboard:
                  </b>
                  Users can create multiple dashboards and share them with other users within TRP 
                  or make them publicly accessible. Public dashboards can be viewed by anyone 
                  without requiring login, simply by accessing the unique dashboard link. To
                   enable this sharing functionality, a shareable link was generated for each 
                   dashboard.
