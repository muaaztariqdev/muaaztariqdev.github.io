          I'm Muhammad Muaaz Tariq, a passionate and detail-oriented Full Stack
          Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience building scalable,
          high-performance web applications. My core expertise spans both
          backend and frontend development â€” from crafting RESTful APIs with
          Node.js, NestJS, and Django, to creating responsive UIs using React,
          TypeScript, and modern design systems like Material UI and Ant Design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've led projects across diverse domains, implemented microservices
          architectures with message queues like RabbitMQ and Kafka, and
          optimized infrastructure on AWS using services like EC2, Lambda, and
          RDS. Whether it's building cloud-native applications, mentoring junior
          developers, or writing clean, reusable code, I bring dedication,
          efficiency, and a problem-solving mindset to every project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive in agile teams and remote environments, and I'm always eager
          to tackle new challenges and deliver impactful solutions.

                <b> Multiple Dashboards: </b>
                Each user is allowed to create and manage multiple dashboards,
                with the option to designate one as the default. The default
                dashboard functions as the user's homepage upon login. In the
                absence of a designated default, the user is redirected to an
                overview page displaying thumbnails of all available dashboards.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b> Exposing API Server: </b>
                A client company required access to the TSIM server's APIs in
                order to integrate its own backend system with the TSIM
                infrastructure. Directing their users to log in to the TSIM
                server was not a viable solution. To facilitate this
                integration, I exposed the necessary server endpoints by
                generating API keys specifically for TSIM clients.
                Authentication between the client's server and the TSIM backend
                was securely handled using the OAuth protocol.

              <b>Description:</b>
              TRP is a telehealth business intelligence platform that
              centralizes and analyzes real-time data from clinical, financial
              and operational sources to gain actionable insights on everything
              from quality of care outcomes to ROI.

              <li>
                <b> Zoom APIs Integration: </b>
                I integrated Zoom APIs to retrieve meeting data for analytical
                purposes, specifically focusing on virtual consultations between
                healthcare providers and patients. The integration captured
                information related to meetings and their participants. To
                enable real-time data processing, Zoom Webhooks were also
                implemented. The registered webhook events included key meeting
                and participant activities such as meeting start and end,
                participant join and leave, screen sharing, and disconnection
                events.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b> Group Based Permission: </b>
                User permissions were managed through user groups, with each
                group assigned access to specific modules. To grant a user
                access to a particular module, the user had to be added to a
                group that already possessed the required permissions. If a user
                needed access to only one specific module (e.g., module M), it
                was necessary to either locate an existing group with access
                solely to that module or create a new group (e.g., group G),
                assign the relevant module permissions to it, and then add the
                user (e.g., user U) to that group. Users who were not assigned
                to any group did not have access to any modules.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Multi-Tenancy:</b>
                The product was designed to support multiple clients,
                necessitating a clear separation of concerns on a per-tenant
                basis. To achieve this, multi-tenancy was implemented in the
                backend. A single backend and database instance served all
                tenants, with the architecture carefully designed to enforce
                tenant isolation and ensure secure, efficient multi-tenant
                operations.

                  >Single-Sign-On with Microsoft Active Directory Federation
                  Services (ADFS):</b
                >
                Single Sign-On (SSO) is typically implemented when product
                tenants prefer to manage user authentication independently and
                avoid sharing user data. This was the case for TRP as well. In
                accordance with the client's requirements, authentication was
                integrated using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).

              <li>
                <b> Share Dashboard: </b>
                Users can create multiple dashboards and share them with other
                users within TRP or make them publicly accessible. Public
                dashboards can be viewed by anyone without requiring login,
                simply by accessing the unique dashboard link. To enable this
                sharing functionality, a shareable link was generated for each
                dashboard.

                <b> In App Video/Audio Calling and Chatting: </b>
                Implemented in-app calling functionality between healthcare
                providers and patients using Twilio. I developed a system for
                creating and managing video call rooms, allowing users to join
                and share media tracks within each session to enable seamless
                communication. Additionally, I integrated a real-time chat
                feature, also powered by Twilio, to support text-based
                interactions within the app.

                <b> Making Metrics for Analytics: </b>
                Defined various health metrics to monitor patient well-being,
                leveraging historical data collected from patients. This data
                was stored across multiple relational tables, and complex SQL
                queries were used to compute the required metrics. To improve
                performance, query optimization techniques such as indexing and
                selective data denormalization were implemented to reduce the
                number of joins and enhance overall efficiency.

                React, Redux, and Ant Design, ensuring high code quality and
                performance optimization throughout. Despite a tight deadline, I
                successfully delivered core modulesâ€”including user
                authentication (sign-up/sign-in), video/audio/text chat, patient
                record uploads, and performance monitoring dashboardsâ€”within
                just two weeks, meeting the client's urgent requirements without
                compromising on quality.
